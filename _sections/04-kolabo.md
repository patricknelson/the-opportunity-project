<p>Through The Opportunity Project, eBay Foundation supports social entrepreneurs with innovative solutions that help small businesses grow, increase the number of quality jobs, and expand access to affordable goods and services. In 2013 we announced our support of Kolabo, an early-stage social enterprise being incubated out of Mercy Corps. Launched in Indonesia with plans to expand to other countries soon, Kolabo helps small businesses create websites and provides digital marketing services that drive traffic to their sites and customers to their doors.
